## Introduction
This is one of those crazy and probably overkill ideas. Practically speaking, there is no need for C# in Half-Life modding, however, it would be fun to think about.

## Implementation

### Phase 1
*TODO: write about this*

## Gains
We'd probably get a few more Unity folks and S&box folks, and people who don't like C++ but like C#. It'd be more beneficial if all Half-Life entities were ported to C# and everything was managed there.
